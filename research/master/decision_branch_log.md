# Decision & Branch Log

## DEC-001
Governance prompt adopted as project operating procedure.
Status: STABLE
Date: 2026-09-04

## DEC-002
Git repository `twkroll/haken-lighthouse-jax` is the single source of truth for canonical project state, prompts, freezes, and results.
Status: STABLE
Date: 2026-09-04

## DEC-003
Initial workstream structure authorized:
- 00 MASTER
- 10 CORE
- 50 APP-1 Computational Neuroscience
- 60 APP-2 Neuromorphic Computing
- 70 APP-3 Differentiable Inference / Temporal Learning
- 80 LIT
- 90 MANUSCRIPT
Status: STABLE
Date: 2026-09-04

## DEC-004
Application workstreams are created only as PROTECTED / WAIT. They may not execute until MASTER opens an explicit gate.
Status: FROZEN
Date: 2026-09-04

## DEC-005
The first scientific task is `CORE Mathematical Scope Gate 0.1`. No implementation, parameter tuning, benchmarking, learning experiment, or application execution precedes this gate.
Status: ACTIVE
Date: 2026-09-04

## DEC-006
MASTER Status Audit 0.2 confirms that `CORE Mathematical Scope Gate 0.1` has not yet been executed in the Git single source of truth. `research/core/STATUS.md` remains READY and no gate result file exists. The later README-only commit `948dedbc5294fbe864b940060ee6b2053020347f` was inspected and does not constitute scientific execution or a freeze violation. No application, literature, or manuscript branch is authorized to proceed.
Status: STABLE
Date: 2026-09-04
